# Teacher app
As a Teacher I want to be able to see which students are in my class each day
of the week so that I can be suitably prepared.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

    EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL
    EXPO_PUBLIC_API_AUTH=EXPO_PUBLIC_API_AUTH
   ```
4. Run tests

   ```
